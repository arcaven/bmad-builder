**Build More, Architect Dreams... With the BMad Builder!**

BMad Builder is so much more than a skill builder. BMad Method modules support:

- **Agents** that transform your AI tool into exactly who you need to talk to — with memory that persists across sessions
- **Workflows** that go far beyond simple tasks into truly guided, facilitated processes that can produce near-infinite steps and turns as needed
- **Modules** that are entire ecosystems, not just skill packs — like the BMad Method module for agile AI-driven development. You can create simpler or vastly more complex modules for any entertainment or work purpose.

## The Dream

Imagine AI that truly knows you — a fitness coach that remembers every PR, a writing partner that knows your characters better than you do, a research assistant that learns your preferences.

BMad Builder lets you create:

- **Personal AI Companions** — Agents with memory that evolve with you over time
- **Domain Experts** — Specialists for any field: legal, medical, creative, technical
- **Workflow Automations** — Structured processes that guide you through complex tasks
- **Custom Modules** — Bundle agents and workflows into shareable packages that can empower any type of business or domain

## What Makes It Different

| Feature | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Persistent Memory** | Agents remember across sessions — they learn and grow |
| **Composable** | Your creations work alongside the entire BMad ecosystem |
| **Skill-Compliant** | Built on open standards that work with any AI tool |
| **Shareable** | Package your modules for the BMad Marketplace (coming soon) |

## What You Can Build

| Domain | Example |
|--------|---------|
| **Personal** | Journal companion, habit coach, learning tutor |
| **Professional** | Code reviewer, documentation specialist, workflow automator |
| **Creative** | Story architect, character developer, campaign designer |
| **Any Domain** | If you can describe it, you can build it |

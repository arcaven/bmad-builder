# Example Custom Content Module

This is a demonstration of custom standalone agents and workflows. By having this content all in a folder with a module.yaml file,
these items can be installed with the standard bmad installer custom local content menu item.

This is how you could also create and share other custom agents and workflows not tied to a specific module.

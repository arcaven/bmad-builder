description: How BMad modules create a shared ecosystem of expertise
---

BMad modules are packaged expertise that can be shared and improved.

## The Vision

**Any expertise can be packaged, shared, and improved.**

A therapist builds a session management module. A lawyer creates a contract review workflow. A novelist designs a character development system. Each becomes available to everyone.

## How It Works

### For Creators

1. **Discovery** — Find a problem you deeply understand
2. **Creation** — Use BMB workflows to build agents and workflows
3. **Validation** — Test with real use cases
4. **Publication** — Publish to npm or the BMad marketplace (coming)

### For Consumers

1. **Discovery** — Browse for modules that solve your problems
2. **Installation** — Install via BMad installer
3. **Customization** — Adapt to your needs
4. **Contribution** — Share improvements back

## Why Modules Matter

### For Individuals

**Solve problems once, benefit forever.**

| Example | Built By | Used By |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Therapist Agent | A therapist | Hundreds of therapists |
| Tax Workflow | An accountant | Thousands of filers |

### For Teams

**Share expertise, not just documents.**

| Traditional | BMad Module |
|-------------|-------------|
| "Here's our 50-page process doc" | "Run this guided workflow" |
| "Ask Alice how to do X" | "Invoke the expert agent" |

### For Communities

Every community has specialized knowledge. BMad lets communities package it.

| Community | Module Potential |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Medical | Diagnosis workflows, treatment planners |
| Legal | Contract templates, case research |
| Education | Lesson planners, assessment generators |
| Creative | Story structures, character frameworks |

## Ecosystem Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Expertise First** | Build by domain experts solving real problems |
| **Interoperability** | Modules work better together |
| **Iteration** | Release early, improve constantly |
| **Community** | Modules can collaborate, not compete |

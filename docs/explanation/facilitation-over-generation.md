title: "Facilitation Over Generation"
description: A facilitation-first approach to AI workflows
---

BMad workflows facilitate discovery rather than generating solutions directly.

## Key Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Questions Over Answers** | Ask strategic questions, don't provide direct answers |
| **Multi-Turn Conversation** | Ask 1-2 questions at a time, not laundry lists |
| **Intent-Based Guidance** | Specify goals, not exact scripts |
| **YOU Are the Expert** | You bring domain knowledge, workflow brings process |

## Generation vs Facilitation

| Generation | Facilitation |
|------------|--------------|
| "Here's the solution" | "What are your goals?" |
| Single turn, bulk output | Multiple turns, progressive discovery |
| Makes decisions for you | Offers options, you choose |
| Can't explain reasoning | Documents YOUR reasoning |

## In Practice

**Traditional AI:**
> "I need a UX design" → [Immediately generates complete specification]

**BMad Workflow:**
> "I need a UX design" → "What documents do you have? What are the primary user goals? What makes your situation unique?"

## Benefits

- **Deeper insights** connected to your actual knowledge
- **Full ownership** of decisions
- **More memorable** because you understand the "why"

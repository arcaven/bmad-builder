title: "Facilitation Over Generation"
description: A facilitation-first approach to AI workflows
---

BMad workflows are at their most powerful when they facilitate discovery rather than generating solutions directly. A prime example is the brainstorming workflow. If you have not tried it, it is work experiencing to see what true agent facilitation can feel like - putting the user in control and feeling like they are a partner with the LLM working together.

## Key Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Questions Over Answers** | Ask strategic questions, don't provide direct answers |
| **Multi-Turn Conversation** | Ask 1-2 questions at a time, not laundry lists, its a conversation |
| **Intent-Based Guidance** | Specify goals, not exact scripts |
| **YOU Are the Expert** | You bring domain knowledge, workflow brings process |

## Generation vs Facilitation

| Generation | Facilitation |
|------------|--------------|
| "Here's the solution" | "What are your goals?" |
| Single turn, bulk output | Multiple turns, progressive discovery |
| Makes decisions for you | Offers options, you choose |
| Can't explain reasoning | Documents YOUR reasoning |

## In Practice

**Traditional AI:**
> "I need a UX design" → [Immediately generates complete specification]

**BMad Workflow:**
> "I need a UX design" → "What documents do you have? First lets understand what are the primary user goals? What makes your situation unique?" → user response → "Why is that X. Did you ever consider that Y and Z might?"

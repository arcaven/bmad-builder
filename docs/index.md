# BMad Builder - A BMad Method EcoSystem Module

**Build More, Architect Dreams.**

## The Dream

Imagine AI that truly knows you — a fitness coach that remembers every PR, a writing partner that knows your characters better than you do, a research assistant that learns your preferences.

BMad Builder lets you create:

- **Personal AI Companions** — Agents with memory that evolve with you over time
- **Domain Experts** — Specialists for any field: legal, medical, creative, technical
- **Workflow Automations** — Structured processes that guide you through complex tasks
- **Custom Modules** — Bundle agents and workflows into shareable packages

## What Makes It Different

| Feature | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Persistent Memory** | Agents remember across sessions — they learn and grow |
| **Composable** | Your creations work alongside the entire BMad ecosystem |
| **Skill-Compliant** | Built on open standards that work with any AI tool |
| **Shareable** | Package your modules for the BMad Marketplace (coming soon) |

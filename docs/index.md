# BMad Builder

**Build impossible things.** AI agents that remember you. Workflows that think. Modules that make you money.

---

You've never used a builder like this. Not even close.

Skills? Plugins? They're isolated, forgettable, dead the moment you install them. BMad is **alive** — a living ecosystem where agents know what you need before you do, workflows build on each other, and everything actually works together.

Build a therapist who remembers your breakthroughs six months later. A tax workflow that finds deductions other tools miss. A fitness coach that evolves with every single workout. Then put it in a module and share it with the world, or build your own super power tools to get ahead.

**Workflows are the SaaS of the future. You're the architect now.**

| Tutorial | What You'll Build | Time |
|----------|-------------------|------|
| **[Create a Custom Agent](docs/tutorials/create-custom-agent.md)** | Your first AI persona with memory | 15-30 min |
| **[Create Your First Workflow](docs/tutorials/create-your-first-workflow.md)** | A process that thinks through problems with you | 30-45 min |
| **[Create Your First Module](docs/tutorials/create-your-first-module.md)** | Package it up, share it, or sell it | 45-60 min |

## What You're Actually Building

This isn't just for developers. This is for anyone who's ever thought "there should be a tool that does this" — and then realized **they can build it.**

| Type | Builder | What It Actually Does |
|------|---------|------------------------|
| **Agents** | Bond | AI personas with memory, expertise, and actual personality |
| **Workflows** | Wendy | Structured processes that guide you through complex challenges step-by-step |
| **Modules** | Morgan | Entire ecosystems you can share with the world (or sell) |

**The secret sauce:** Unlike plugins that die in isolation, BMad modules form an intelligent network. Agents know when to suggest workflows. Workflows call the right agents automatically. The help system knows what you're trying to do before you do.

## Build Anything (Seriously)

**BMad isn't just for software.** Build modules for literally any domain:

| Domain | Example | What It Actually Does |
|--------|---------|------------------------|
| **Mental Health** | Therapist Agent | Remembers your patterns, notices what you don't, celebrates breakthroughs you forgot |
| **Money** | Tax Workflow Module | Finds deductions other tools miss, creates bulletproof documentation |
| **Creative** | Story Architect Module | Character arcs, plot holes, dialogue that doesn't sound like a robot |
| **Learning** | Personal Tutor Module | Remembers how YOUR brain works, adapts accordingly |
| **Fitness** | Coach Module | Reads your progress, evolves your plan, truly cares |
| **Music** | Songwriter's Assistant | Lyrics, chords, arrangements — remembers your style |
| **Cooking** | Personal Chef Module | "What can I actually make with this?" — answered forever |
| **Travel** | Trip Planner Module | Local secrets, budget optimization, schedules that work |
| **Parenting** | Family Coordinator | Activity ideas, milestone tracking, sanity preservation |
| **Gaming** | D&D Campaign Module | Characters that matter, worlds that breathe, stories that remember |
| **Spirituality** | Meditation Guide | Sessions that adapt to your actual progress |
| **Sports** | Coach Module | Training plans that evolve, strategy that learns |
| **Gardening** | Garden Planner | Crop selection, pest control, harvest tracking |

**From agents that remember your deepest dreams to workflows that find money you didn't know existed — if you can imagine it, you can build it.**

## The Marketplace Is Coming

Build something incredible? Soon you'll be able to publish to the BMad marketplace.

**Your workflow could be someone's favorite tool. Your module could fund your life.**

This isn't hypothetical. People are already building tools that solve real problems in ways no SaaS company ever would — because they're building **their** solutions, not some product manager's idea of what they need.
